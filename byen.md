My name is Brandon Yen, and I am a senior undergraduate Computer Science major at UTK. 
I recently completed an internship creating software that allows users to calibrate and compare measured data on coal samples.
In my free time, I enjoy reading, coding, and playing strategy games such as Chess and Go.
