I am Joseph Lavalle-Rivera. I graduated from West Point with a BS in Systems Engineering and from UNC-Chapel Hill with a MS in Statistics and Operations Research. I am a PhD student in the Bredesen Center's Data Science and Engineering program. I am currently a major in the US Army. I am extremely excited for this class and look forward to learning the tools and techniques for gathering, analyzing, and presenting disparate forms of data.
