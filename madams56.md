I am Mark Adams and I am a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at UTK.
I've worked at Oak Ridge National Laboratory for 9 years performing research and development using simulation, modeling, HPC, data science, and machine learning.
Outside of work and school, I also work at a small startup spun out of ORNL developed technology and spend time with my family.
