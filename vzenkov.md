I am Viktor Zenkov. I am a graduate student. My background includes two internships using machine learning and other skills, along with all the required material for getting my undergraduate degree. I am interested in most computer science topics, and would potentially be interested in a project related to blockchain. I enjoyed taking CS340 with Dr. Mockus and I am back for more.
