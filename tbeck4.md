I am Tyler Beck and I am an undergraduate (senior) in nuclear engineering minoring in CS.
I have interests in advanced radiation detection methods as well as advanced reactors, particularly the molten salt reactor. 
These fields have a variety of subfields, many of which have application to C.S. and data analysis.
