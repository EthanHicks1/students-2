  I am Justin Sumner and I am a senior studying CS. I am returning to UT this semester after taking a year off to work a Co-op with Nissan North America at their manufacturing facility in Smyrna, TN (just outside Nashville). While at Nissan, most of my work focused on data analytics with a focus on tying together data stored in multiple databases and developing dashboards for real time analytics as well as a few machine learning applications.
  I am taking Digital Archeology because my long term goal is to pursue a career in data science. In my free time I enjoy running, hiking, or really just about anything to get away from a screen for a little while.
