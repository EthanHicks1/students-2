I am Julian Ball and I am majoring in Computer Science. I am taking Digital Archeology because I find myself in many group projects and dealing 
with data collection and organization. I feel that this class will help me in these areas and encourage me to work more with git. I also 
really enjoy getting to wokr on group projects.
