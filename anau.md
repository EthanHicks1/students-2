Hello! My name is Anna-Maria Nau and I am getting my Ph.D. in Data Science and Engineering. I did my bachelor's degree in applied mathematics and have experience working with Python/R/SQL from industry/course work. I enjoy to code, analyze data and being challenged. In my free time, I love to play tennis, travel and explore new places.
