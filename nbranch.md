I am Noah Branch currently Majoring in Computer science. 
If I am not studying then typically I am at the gym or at home hopefully playing video games.
I really wasn't sure what digital Archaeology was so I'm hoping to learn somthing new and apply I to my own personal projects
and in the real world.
