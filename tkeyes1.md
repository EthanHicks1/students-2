I am Thomas Keyes and I am an undergrad senior at UTK.
I found CS as a senior in high school, then proceeded with the major and had internships within software development and thoroughly enjoyed them.
Outside of school or work, I love to golf and play guitar as hobbies, and I recently started collecting record albums.
